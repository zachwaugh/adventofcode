## 2024
Using Python. It's one the languages I don't know well at all and have never used in prouction. Like Zig, this is probably bad and non-idiomatic Python. All code here [2024](/2024/), run each day (`python3 day1.py`) to see the output.


## 2023
Didn't have time this year!


## 2022
For 2022, back to what I know and doing it in Swift. All code here [2022](/2022/Source/), open `AdventOfCode.xcodeproj` and run. Alter the puzzle in `main.swift` to do different days.


## 2021

My solutions in Zig for this 2021 Advent of Code. I don't currently know much Zig, but I've been looking for an excuse to try it out, so I'm learning as I go. This is probably bad Zig code! If you want to run this code, just install [Zig](https://ziglang.org) and run each file (`zig run day1.zig`) to see the output.
